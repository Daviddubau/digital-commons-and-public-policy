# Navigation

This is a GitHub Pages static website designed for the purpose of teaching Public Affairs Students from Sciences Po Paris about Digital Commons. It's made of:

- [announcements](announcements.md),
- a weekly [course Syllabus](syllabus.md),
- a [staff](staff.md) page,
- and a weekly [schedule](schedule.md).

## It's collaborative !
Of course it's handy to have a site publicly available with the course material. 
Though here the principal purpose is to teach students about how software is made by providing them an hands experience with no coding requirements. 
We'll try and have them create the entries for each week, solve issues, choose a licence etc. all by submitting [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).
We'll use the Github UI to do so but most saavy students can make their changes locally (see bellow).

### Local development environment

Just the Class requires no special Jekyll plugins and can run on GitHub Pages' standard Jekyll compiler. To setup a local development environment, clone your template repository and follow the GitHub Docs on [Testing your GitHub Pages site locally with Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll).

### Credits
The template used to generate this website is [Just the Class](https://github.com/kevinlin1/just-the-class) which extends the popular [Just the Docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs) theme, which provides a robust and thoroughly-tested foundation. Just the Docs include features such as:

- automatic [navigation structure](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/navigation-structure/),
- instant, full-text [search](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/search/) and page indexing,
- and a set of [UI components](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/ui-components) and authoring [utilities](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/utilities).

Just the Class has been used by instructors at Stanford University ([CS 161](https://stanford-cs161.github.io/winter2021/)), UC Berkeley ([Data 100](https://ds100.org/fa21/)), UC Santa Barbara ([CSW8](https://ucsb-csw8.github.io/s22/)), Northeastern University ([CS4530/5500](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-CS5500-Spring-2021/)), and Carnegie Mellon University ([17-450/17-950](https://cmu-crafting-software.github.io/)).
